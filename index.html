      <p>Canada is also known as "The Great White North" due to its vast expanse of cold, snowy landscapes in the northern regions. This nickname reflects the country's reputation for having long and harsh winters. Additionally, Canada is sometimes referred to as "The True North, Strong and Free," which is taken from the national anthem "O Canada." The phrase emphasizes the country's geographical position as well as its commitment to freedom and independence.</p>
